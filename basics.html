        <h2>Personal Favorite</h2>
        <p><em><strong>Final Fantasy 15</strong></em> is my personal favorite game despite its many shortcomings. I love both the story and characters of the game which fit perfectly into the rpg element of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> video game series. Even if the combat for the game leaves mush to be desired the story and characters make up for that by a mile</p>
